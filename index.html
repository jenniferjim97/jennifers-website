    <h2><em>About:</em></h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Jennifer Jimenez and I currently reside in Brooklyn, New York. I use to work as a server in Manhattan and Brooklyn for a few years before making the decision of switching over to software development.
      I was fortunate enough to be introduced to coding in highschool after joining an all girl tech club. Enrolling into college made me realize that it was not for me because of all the unnecessary classes I needed to complete in order to
      continue on with my career (which honestly was a bit unmotivating). Attempting the self-taught route of coding helped me make the final decision on starting this new venture.
